A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/akwright/pen/raBdOO.

 Gradient ghost buttons and text.
Duplicating dribbble shot http://drbl.in/mPFZ by Mike Busby https://dribbble.com/MikeBusby by utilizing border image and box shadows. WIP - need to change direction of box shadows.

Box shadow mixin based off of John Grishin's (http://codepen.io/exah/) box-shadow implementation, found here: http://codepen.io/exah/pen/Lqyem

Currently, gradient text is WebKit only.

EDIT: 

- Updated the pen to use flexbox to display options.

- Added border / background gradient combo as best option

- Fixed box-shadows to go from diagonal to horizontal

- Added some comments and formatting for readability
